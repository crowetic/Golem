# Golem

Welcome to the official repo of the new Golem Codes smart Kernel by Scare Crowe. The initial repo will be released under crowetic's git, and subsequently will be moved to the official Qortal git location.

There are individual readme files in multiple directories, including the 'kernel' directory for specific information regarding the kernel itself. All the design and schematics are under git root and uploaded under GPL and their corresponding licenses. The build instructions are specific to debian based linux distros only. If you are looking for cross compile then head over to Qortal Telegram Tech Support.
